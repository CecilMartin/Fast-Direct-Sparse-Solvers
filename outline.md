# Final presentation outline

1. Intro & algorithm

2. Compression of HOLRD matrix

Fig 1. Verification of linear complexity of Holdr matrix, Laplace dirichlet BVP,  computing time vs n, different epsilon.

3. Complexity comparison

Laplacian/Helmhotz Dirichlet BVP. Standard 5pt stencil for square unit in 2D

Fig2. Sweeping scheme, computing time vs N, Laplacian and Helmhotz problem(different \kappa)

Fig3. Sweeping scheme and buffered sweeping scheme, large n2, compare different b, i.e. width of buffer

4. Difficulty and TODO
